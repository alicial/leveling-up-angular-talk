After you've developed that first demo app using the Angular JavaScript framework, now what? This presentation covers patterns and strategies for developing more complex apps using Angular, avoiding pitfalls, and how to write your own directives and components the "Angular Way".

Angular is a wonderful JavaScript framework to get up and running with. You are writing less code, and things just work like magic. However, as your app becomes more complex and as you start porting over functionality from existing JavaScript, you need a sound architecture to contain all the pieces. This presentation helps to fill the gap between the demo app and the complexities encountered in developing a real-world app.
